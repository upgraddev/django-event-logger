# Django Event Logger

A Django app to log events in database, on changes to a model field.

## Features
* Tracked models and fields can be customized in the JSON config
* Events can be selectively logged only if certain conditions on the object are satisfied, to avoid logging useless data
* Additional data (from global constants, object attributes) can also be logged along with field changes to give more context to the event

## Quickstart
#### To install Django Event Logger
```
git clone https://<user_name>@bitbucket.org/upgrad_dev/django_event_logger.git
cd django_event_logger/
python setup.py install
```
#### To include Django Event Logger in your Django Application
In your settings file:
```
INSTALLED_APPS += ('event_logger')
EVENT_LOGGER_OUTPUT_FORMAT = {} # Config for the different columns in the event logging table(more details below)
EVENT_LOGGER_TRACKED_FIELDS = {} # Config for specifying which models and fields to track and when (more details below)
```

## Config Description
#### Config for logging of additional attributes along with the events, such as request details
```
EVENT_LOGGER_OUTPUT_FORMAT = {
    "imports": ["<import statment>"], # List of import statements to fetch relevant objects and libraries (can include pre-processing steps as well)
    "columns": {
        "<column_name>": { # Name of column of the event table (Add more keys to get more columns)
            "object_name": "<Name of object, can be the one imported above or _object to refer to the object being updated>",
            "property": "<Property of the object that needs to be logged under the column_ame>",
            "default": "<default_value in case the above is None>"
        },
    }
```
#### Config for specifying which models and fields to be tracked along with the conditional logic on when to log their changes
```
EVENT_LOGGER_TRACKED_FIELDS = {
    "<app_name>": {
        "<model_name>": {
            "<field_name>": {
                "conditions": [ # List of list of conditions (Conditions in the outer list are combined by the AND operator, and conditions in the inner lists are combined by the OR operator)
                    [{
                        "property": "<property>.<nested_property>", # Property of the old_object which is going to be updated (supports nesting using '.' delimiter)
                        "operator": "==", # Operator to use for comparision
                        "value": "'<right_hand_side>'" # Value to compare the property (Can also be an object of the form: {"property": "<other_property"})
                    }],
                ]
            }
        }
    },
}

#### The underlying table for storing events (event_logger_eventlog) will contain the following base attributes:
    1. *id* - Auto-incrementing integer ID for the table
    2. *app_name* - Name of the app which generated the event
    3. *model_name* - Name of the model which generated the event
    4. *object_id* - The ID of the object in the model which was created/updated
    5. *field_name* - The name of the tracked attribute of the object which was changed
    6. *before* - The value of the attribute prior to the change (null in case of creation)
    7. *after* - The updated value of the tracked attribute
    8. *column_type* - The before/after value are cast as strings, this field captures the python data type of the attribute
    9. *timestamp* - The timestamp when the event was logged in the events table
